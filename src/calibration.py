"""
ColorChecker Classic (24-patch) detection + color-correction calibration.

Pipeline:
  1. Propose several candidate quadrilaterals for where the card might be,
     using multiple independent segmentation strategies (see
     `_candidate_quads` below) -- deliberately liberal, since a real photo
     can have hair/clothing/jewelry that looks card-like to any one of
     them on its own.
  2. For EVERY candidate: perspective-warp it, detect the 24 patches
     inside, and check how well their colors match the card's actual
     known reference colors (Hungarian-matched CIEDE... well, Euclidean
     RGB distance here, then a proper affine solve). This is the real
     filter: a hair/clothing/jewelry region will not have anything
     resembling a match to the specific 24 reference colors, so its
     error stays high, while the true card (even from an imperfectly
     segmented candidate) matches closely.
  3. Keep only the candidate with the lowest resulting color-matching
     error. This makes automatic detection robust without needing a
     person to manually crop the card -- the known, fixed set of colors
     on the card is itself the strongest signal for "this is the card".

The same `calibrate_from_image()` function is used both when building the
foundation DB (photo of card + foundation swatch) and when a user submits
a face photo (photo of card + face) -- in both cases we first figure out
"what this camera/lighting did to a known color" and correct the *other*
thing in the same photo by the same transform.

    guess -- e.g. the hue-grid strategy pads a tight cluster of detected
    color patches outward by an assumed, fixed proportion to estimate
    where the card's actual edge is, which can overshoot (even past the
    photo's own edge on some tilts/angles) or undershoot depending on how
    the card sits in the frame, and can leave the card still sitting at a
    slight angle in the warped preview instead of flat.

    Picking any single corner (or 4 corners) of the grid to anchor a
    refit is fragile: the corner cells are exactly the ones most likely
    to be inferred/extrapolated rather than directly detected (dark
    patches like black_20 aren't picked up by the bright-patch contour
    step at all), so their individual position error is the highest of
    any cell in the grid -- basing the whole refit on just those 4 points
    means inheriting their worst-case error. Using all 24 detected patch
    centers is far more robust: we know their IDEAL positions exactly (a
    perfect 6x4 grid of unit cells, since that's the ColorChecker
    Classic's fixed physical layout) and can fit a single homography
    mapping that ideal grid to where the centers actually landed in this
    warp -- a 24-point least-squares fit averages out any one cell's
    noise instead of being dictated by it.

    `border_units` (in the same unit-cell scale) is deliberately small
    and slightly NEGATIVE by default: trying to extrapolate all the way
    out to the card's true physical edge (past the patches, out to its
    printed black border) turned out to be unreliable in practice -- any
    real camera has a little lens distortion a single homography can't
    model, and that error only grows when extrapolated beyond the fitted
    points, which is exactly what produced the persistent sliver of
    background this replaces. Landing slightly INSIDE the outermost
    patches instead is a much safer bet: it can never expose background,
    since it never leaves the region we actually, directly observed to
    be patch color, at the cost of not showing the card's own printed
    border in the preview -- a fine trade since only the 24 patch colors
    need to stay legible, not the card's physical frame. Mapping those 4
    points back through the INVERSE of this warp into the original
    image, then re-warping with them, "pulls"/stretches the patches to
    fill the whole canonical frame in one shot.
